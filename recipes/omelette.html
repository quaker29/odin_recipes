            <h3>Look at that fluffy omelette.</h3>
            <p>A souffle omelette is just like a classic omelette but made fluffy by using stiff peak egg whites to the yolk. This version of the omelette is accompanied by a signature tomato sauce and cooked on a stovetop unlike the traditional and classical oven-baked souffle omelette.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>tomato sauce</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, place an egg and a pinch of salt. Mix with an electric mixer for 5 minutes until white and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Heat butter in a frying pan, pour in the batter, cook on medium for a minute, then cover and cook on low for about a minute.</li>
            <li>Fold the omelette in half, serve on a plate, then pour some tomato sauce over it.</li>
        </ol>
