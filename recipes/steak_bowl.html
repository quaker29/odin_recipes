        <h3 class="center-1">Who doesn't love a good steak bowl.</h3>
        <p class="center-1">This steak bowl is on another level. The balance between the rice and steak is equally rivaled by the sauce flowing down the bowl. It is probably better than Chipotle if I am being honest. You can quote me on that.</p>

    <h2 class="center-1">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef sirloin</li>
            <li>Lots of onions</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Potato starch</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Umeboshi paste</li>
            <li>Pickled Plum</li>
            <li>Red wine</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="center-1">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the onions finely.</li>
            <li>Remove the tendons from the beef and beat it with a meat tenderizer until as flat as possible.</li>
            <li>Cover meat on both sides with the chopped onion and leave for 30 minutes or more. Remove the onion and add salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook the steak to your preference(most would prefer medium-rare). Remove from heat and melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan and fry the onion used for the beef until it changes color. Adjust the flavor with salt and pepper, then move the onion to the steak.</li>
            <li>Melt the remaining butter in the frying pan and fry the sides of the meat before taking it out.</li>
        </ol>

    <h4 class="center-1">Making the sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add red wine to the frying pan used for the beef to deglaze it. Boil down the wine while scraping off the meat juice.</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce and mix with everything. Adjust seasonings to personal preferences.</li>
            <li>Thicken with dissolved potato starch.</li>
        </ol>
