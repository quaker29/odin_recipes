        <h3>Watch out Chick fil-A a new player is in town.</h3>
        <p>What can I say, it is a deadly combination. Just imaging biting into some crispy fried chicken and following that up with a nice crunch of a lettuce leaf. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb chicken thigh meat, bite size pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 grated yellow onion</li>
            <li>1/2 grated fuji apple</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sake</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp chicken bouillon</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp chili paste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>Dash of fish sauce</li>
            <li>Squeeze of lemon</li>
            <li>Potato starch</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by marinating the chicken thigh pieces. Add the chicken, onion, apple, sake, soy sauce, chili pepper, bouillon, and salt and pepper to a bag or a bowl. Massage the chicken a good 3-4 minutes, and set aside in the fridge for at least thirty minutes to take on some of that flavor. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce. Add the chili paste, ketchup, fish sauce, and lemon juice to a bowl, and stir. Set aside till ready to use.</li>
            <li>Bring vegetable oil to 350 F. Remove the karaage from the marinade and coat liberally in potato starch. I find this easiest to do by plopping the individual pieces of chicken into a pile of starch, and then popping them directly in the oil. Of course, you can just toss the chicken in a bag of potato starch, but remember to remove as much of the marinade as possible to avoid over-clumping. Fry in batches of 4-5 to maintain oil temperature, about 3 minutes per side. Occasionally lift out of the oil to mimic the double-frying technique. Allow to drain/cool on a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Serve with lettuce leaves of your choice. Guests can take a few pieces of karaage, wrap them in the leaves, and dip liberally in the chili dipping sauce. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
